*The problem-statement that is to be solved is to detect GW signals from the mergers of binary black holes. Specifically, you'll build a model to analyze simulated GW time-series data from a network of Earth-based detectors.*

## Why this is a problem in the first place?
The gravitational wave detector that were used to detect the waves have inherent noise in their output signal. So say that when the output is produced we donot clearly distinguish whether that is a noise of that contains some signal too (**Imagine the probability of (merging of black hole and of getting the signal in the detector present on the earth**).
So researchers are trying out data analysis techniques to automate the process of signal detection i.e. to find if the output signal from detector is only **'noise'** or is it **'signal+noise'**.
